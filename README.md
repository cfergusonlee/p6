# Creating a Tableau Story: 2012 PISA Dataset

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

Over 510,000 students from 62 countries took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science, representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those countries, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy. Score data was not skewed by participation level but it was scaled using a calibration data set of 31,500 students.

Countries that scored below 450 on previous PISA tests were offered an easier version of the assessment. This was designed to better assess what students at the lower end of the spectrum understood. Two countries accepted the offer and although it was at a lower difficulty, the results were still comparable to every other PISA participant.

This project cleans and prepares the data in Python, then visualizes it in Tableau.
