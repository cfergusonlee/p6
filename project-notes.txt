Exploration ideas:
- Interactive map of the world with pisa scores
- World Pisa scores by Country Dashboard. Three panes:
	- World map with dropdown for category
	- link to country education page on wikipedia
	- Bar graph or histogram for each country
- Use dual axis to show overlay of reading, science and math scores
- Small multiples with maps for reading, science and math scores
- Use filters to showcase certain parts of the data
	- There are many psychological survey questions. Display the filter so users can choose to see how each question affects the results
- Create sets of countries based on criteria (performance?):
	- Low
	- Medium
	- High
- Think carefully about whether / how you'd use groups
- Consider combined sets or sets based on criteria to look for shared trends:
	- Ex: select high-performing group and see what they have in common with other data points
- Create a calculated field (math/science score or some other calculation)
- Use a table calculation to show the percent difference, percentage of total or rank
- Combine with other years to show country rankings over time
- Use the categorical variables as field options and show how scores of different groups compare.

	- Compare student view vs teacher view?

		- Perceived control
		- Perseverence
		- Sense of belonging
		- Subjective norms
	- Teacher support
	- Behavior

	- Cognition
		- 
	- Experience
		- Exp with math tasks
		- Familiarit with math concepts
		- First use of internet and computers
	- Demographics
		- Wealth
		- Gender
		- Grade repetition
		- Immigration status
	- Work-related
		- Future orientation
		- School to work
- Schools / Leadership
- Home life (parents included)
	- Acculturation / heritage
	- Family information (parents, grandparents, siblings, etc)
	- Wealth
	- First language learned


Todo:
- Clean data:
	- Check variable categories
	- Split data if multiple variables in one column
	- Review tidy data guidelines
- Manipulating variables
	- Consider creating your own heirarchy
- Adding more data:
	- Consider adding employment data with a union to show employment outcomes
	- Consider adding population data with a union to look for patterns
- Learn how Quantitative Variables are set up

Feedback:
Hey Bud, for my next project I need to create a visualization in Tableau and get feedback from others. Below is a summary of the project goals and a link to the project. Do you think you could give me your first thoughts / constructive feedback on the visualizations? Here are a few areas I’m trying to focus on:

1. What do you notice in the visualization?
2. What questions do you have about the data?
3. What relationships do you notice?
4. What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
5. Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

P.S. I forgot to mention there are 3 story points in the visualization. You can navigate to each using the arrows on either side of the grey boxes. One of the goals for this project is to get a first draft out, iterating on it through feedback and document the process. Please let me know if there’s anything I could change or add (including adding more story points) that would improve the draft. Thanks again and let me know what you think.
