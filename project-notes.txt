Exploration ideas:
- Interactive map of the world with pisa scores
- US Pisa scores by state
	- link to wikipedia
	- include bar graph
- Use dual axis to show overlay of reading, science and math scores
- Small multiples with maps for reading, science and math scores
- Use filters to showcase certain parts of the data
- Create sets of countries based on criteria (performance?):
	- Low
	- Medium
	- High
- Think carefully about whether / how you'd use groups
- Consider combined sets or sets based on criteria to look for shared trends:
	- Ex: select high-performing group and see what they have in common with other data points
- Create a calculated field (math/science score or some other calculation)
- Use a table calculation to show the percent difference, percentage of total or rank
- Combine with other years to show country rankings over time

Todo:
- Clean data:
	- Check variable categories
	- Split data if multiple variables in one column
	- Review tidy data guidelines
- Manipulating variables
	- Consider creating your own heirarchy
- Adding more data:
	- Consider adding employment data with a union to show employment outcomes
	- Consider adding population data with a union to look for patterns

Feedback:
Hey ___, for my next project I need to create a visualization story and get feedback from others. Below is a summary of the project goals and a link to the visualizations I created. Could you please give me some constructive feedback? Thanks in advance!
